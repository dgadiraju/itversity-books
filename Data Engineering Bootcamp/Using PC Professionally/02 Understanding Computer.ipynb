    "* Once we get hardware first we will install operating system.\n",
    "* At the lowest level, operating system is software which take instructions from us and work with hardware components to get us what we are looking for.\n",
    "* On top of OS, we will be installing application software.\n",
    " * Browsers\n",
    " * Media Players\n",
    " * Editors\n",
    " * and many more.\n",
    "* Some of the applications come as part of the Operating System itself while others need to be manually installed by us.\n",
    "* Here is the typical installation process for 3rd party applications (that might not come with Operating System)\n",
    " * Download Software related to application\n",
    " * Install the application\n",

    "* Operating Systems can be used personally or for running applications. Here we will be primarily covering how to use laptops at work effectively to improve our productivity for day to day activities.\n",
    " * Windows 7 or 8 or 10, Mac, Ubuntu Desktop etc are used for personal usage\n",
    " * Windows NT or Server, Unix Flavors, RedHat Linux, Suse Linux are used for running applications. They are also knows as server operating systems.\n",
    "* Laptops you will get in your office will be either Windows based desktops or Mac based desktops. Some startups rely on Linux based ones.\n",
    " * If permitted make sure you have latest stable versions of respective operating system in use. For example use Windows 10.\n",
    "* As part of this module we will see important tools related to Windows as well as Mac. Those who are using Linux based laptops can follow Mac based demos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux based systems on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we develop using desktop operating systems such as Windows 10, applications will be deployed on server based operating systems (typically Linux flavor such as RedHat Linux, Suse Linux etc) and hence it is highly desired you have access to Linux based environment on your Windows based system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will talk about how to setup Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux (a Ubuntu Linux based virtual machine on Windows 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If Subsystem for Linux is not available then you can use Virtual Box or VMWare Player/Workstation to setup virtual machines.\n",
    " * If virtual machines are not allowed, then you can use Linux terminal emulator tools like Cygwin for some of the Linux based tasks for your applications.\n",
    " * You can also use several GUI based tools to improve productivity to interact with remote servers from your PC.\n",
    "   * putty or some advanced SSH tools – to connect to remote servers\n",
    "   * Winscp or Filezilla – to copy files between your PC and servers\n",
    "* Some important terms\n",

    "* Open Windows Power Shell as an admin and run the below command. Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\n",
    "* Now you can install the Linux distribution of your own choice. Preferred to use Ubuntu.\n",
    "* Click on Ubuntu distribution that launches the ubuntu terminal on windows.\n",
    "* Windows Subsystem for Linux is much tightly integrated virtual machine with host. It gives more flexibility than VMware and VM VirtualBox.\n",
    "* Give the username and password for Ubuntu. Once the setup is done use the commands <mark>ls -ltr</mark> and <mark>ls -altr</mark> to list out all the files.\n",
    "* The .profile and .bashrc files controls all the environment settings.\n",
    "* apt install is the command to download and install packages in ubuntu.\n",
    "* use apt help to get more detailed information about the command.\n",

    "***Setting environment variables in Windows***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to Environment Variables and then choose System Variables unless explicitly specified as part of instructions.\n",
    "* There are two types of environment variables  –  **_HOME** and **PATH**\n",
    "* **_HOME** is set to base directory of the application. Base directory is nothing but main directory into which files related to the software installed is copied.\n",
    "* The **PATH** is the system variable that your operating system uses to locate needed executables from the command line or Terminal window.\n",
    "* Executables will be typically under bin directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Example***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us download and install Java and understand what it actually mean. We will see both on Windows or Linux (if you are using Mac you can follow Linux instructions)\n",

    "* Search for JDK and download fro\n",
    "* Go to file explorer on Windows – C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk\n",
    "* On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables, and then edit JAVA_HOME to point to this location.\n",
    "* So, typically we will be setting JAVA_HOME to base directory which also has many sub-directories including bin directory.\n",
    "* We need to update PATH variable to bin directory to get executables to run.\n",
    "* Set the PATH environment variable if you want to be able to easily run the executables (javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe etc.) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command. In case, the PATH variable is not set, you need to specify the full path to the executable every time you run it on terminal – C:\\Java\\jdk1.7.0\\bin\\javac MyClass.java\n",
    "* Now, try running javac from terminal after setting the PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases installation will take care of updating global profiles and registries (in windows).We need not configure anything.\n",
    "* You can validate following these instructions\n",
    " * <mark>echo $PATH</mark>– This will give you the directory path that is set in PATH variable. For Windows, you can say <mark>echo %PATH%</mark>\n",
    " * <mark>which -ls</mark> – It returns the pathnames of the files which would be executed in the current environment (on Mac or Linux)\n",

    "Quite often we might have to edit some plain text files. Here are some of the tips related to editing text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* People tend to use notepad or Microsoft Word for editing text files.\n",
    " * Notepad is very primitive and it is counter productive.\n",
    " * Microsoft Word is not for plain text, it is primarily to create files with images (images are not plain text)\n",
    "* Do not use notepad or Microsoft Word for text editing.\n",
    "* If it is code better to use IDEs (advanced editors and specific to programming languages)\n",
    "* If it is just plain text use standard text editors. Here are some of the features of standard text editors.\n",
    " * Support for regular expressions\n",
    " * Ability to edit files on remote servers\n",
    " * Columnar Selection\n",
    " * Macros – for replayable text editing\n",
    " * Popular editors are – Notepad++, Ultraedit, Sublime Text\n",
    " \n",
    "We would highly recommend to choose Sublime Text or any one editor of your choice and be expert with it. It might take around 40 hours, but it will save thousands of hours in your career.\n",
    "* Depending on target servers we need to configure editors to save files in particular modes like DOS mode or unix mode.\n",

    "## Software Engineering Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get quick overview of Software Engineering Lifecycle – starting from requirement, to development and then all the way through making it available to the users of the application.\n",

    "* Application Testing by Test team\n",
    "* User acceptance test by BA or business users\n",
    "* Release Management team push to Prod environment\n",
    "* Make the application GA (generally available)\n",
    "* We use Waterfall or Agile methodology for the applications.\n",

    "## Connecting to remote servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us understand details related to connecting to remote servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once the application is deployed in production, it will be supported by L1 support team.\n",
    "* Developers are considered as L3 support, if L1 support think that it is issue with respect to application then developers need to troubleshoot the issue.\n",
    " * Troubleshoot the application failure by analysing logs\n",
    " * Data related issues by running queries in the database or by reviewing the logic in the code.\n",
    "* Developers might have to connect to the production servers with restricted permissions to understand the problem and then reproduce it. Here are different alternatives using which developers can connect to remote servers.\n",
    " * ssh tools\n",
    " * putty or Cygwin on Windows 8 or earlier. Putty is primitive, better to use terminal or some advanced tools in Windows other than putty.\n",
    " * Linux subsystem in Windows 10.\n",
    " * Terminal on Mac/Linux\n",
    "* Keep in mind that once the source for the problem is identified, the issue should be reproduced locally and go through the entire life cycle to fix the issue.\n",
