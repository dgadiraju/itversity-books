    "### Overview of REPL and Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see details about REPL and how we can get started with Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can launch Scala REPL using **Scala**\n",
    "* REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It is an interactive way of building logic.\n",
    "* You can perform arithmetic operations, invoke functions, or even develop functions.\n",
    "* Each line of code is evaluated separately by being compiled into Java bytecode. Hence many times each line can be treated in an isolated way. Due to that, we should be able to define variables with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to specify whether a variable is mutable or immutable while defining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* val is for immutable variable\n",
    "* var is for mutable variable\n",
    "* Once an immutable variable is created using val, we will not be able to reassign into it.\n",
    "* It is optional to define a variable with the Data Type and mandatory to assign with a value.\n",
    "* Based on the value assigned, the variable will inherit Data Type.\n",
    "* Even though we do not have to explicitly define variables, Scala Variable is still a Statically Typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Help**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get some usage related information on the functions and classes as part of REPL. We will give a demo of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Listing Functions\n",
    "* Getting a list of overloaded functions with arguments\n",
    "* Getting a list of all functions along with few details for a given Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different things, which you need to understand about Functions and Arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pre-defined Functions (example String Manipulation Functions)\n",
    "* User-defined Functions (sum of integers using loops)\n",
    "* Functions with a Varying number of Arguments\n",
    "* Lambda or Anonymous Functions."
