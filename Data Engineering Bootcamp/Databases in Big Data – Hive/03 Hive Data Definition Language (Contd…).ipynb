    "### Comparison with RDBMS\n",
    "Let us understand the difference between Hive Databases and traditional RDBMS Databases.\n",
    "* Traditional RDBMS is used for mission-critical transaction based applications.\n",
    "* There are some differences with respect to Data Types – eg: string is not available as the data type for tables in databases like Oracle.\n",
    "* Data Models are typically Normalized into parent tables and child tables.\n",
    "* Data is loaded into tables using DML statements like insert or using tools like SQLLDR.\n",
    "* We can access data from tables only using queries, we cannot directly read data from underlying files and make some sense out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hive Delimiters\n",
    "As Hive Table’s Metadata is decoupled from actual data, we typically need to specify delimiters while creating the tables using Text File Format. Let us understand more about the Delimiters in Hive tables of type Text File Format.\n",
    "* When we create tables in Hive, data will reside in HDFS and metadata will be in Metastore.\n",
    "* Using Hive Metastore we can query metadata of our tables.\n",
    "* **describe formatted** give all the details about metadata of a table.\n",
    "* LOCATION will tell us under which HDFS directory data resides\n",
    "* Unlike in RDBMS, we can access files in HDFS directly.\n",
    "* Even though we can run statements like insert, update and delete etc on Hive tables, it is not very common. There is a lot of overhead when ever we try to perform traditional DML statements on Hive tables.\n",
    "* We can use **show create table** command to get the statement which can be used to create table with similar structure else where.\n",
    "* We can specify delimiters for text data.\n",
    "* We need to use LOAD command to copy files into Hive tables directly or INSERT command to save query results into Hive table.\n",
    "* We will get into details with respect to LOAD and INSERT at a later point in time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hive – Schema on Read\n",
    "Let us understand the concept of **Schema on Read** when it comes to Hive.\n",
    "* When we insert data into a hive table without any delimiter it will take ASCII null by default\n",
    "* We can use Describe formatted to locate out table HDFS location directly\n"
