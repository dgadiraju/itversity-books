    "### Overview of sed and awk:\n",
    "* **SED** is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution).\n",
    "* SED command supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.\n",
    "* By using SED you can edit files even without opening it, which is much quicker way to find and replace * something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.\n",
    "* **Usage of sed:**The s,%,$,g part of the command line is the sed command to execute.The s stands for substitute, the , characters are delimiters (other characters can be used; / , : and @ are popular).\n",
    "* **Syntax of sed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...]```\n",
    "\n",
    "```man sed - displays the manual pages of sed```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To replace the string ‘complete’ with ‘completed’\n",
    "\n",
    "```sed -e 's/COMPLETE/COMPLETED/g' filename```\n",
    "\n",
    "* To print 4th line in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```sed -n '4'p filename```\n",
    "\n",
    "* To print last line in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```sed -n '$'p filename```\n",
    "\n",
    "* To deletes 3rd line to last line\n",
    "\n",
    "```sed '3,$d' filename```\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWK:\n",
    "\n",
    "AWK  command is a powerful method for processing or analyzing text files—in particular, data files that are organized by lines (rows) and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```man awk - displays the manual pages of awk```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To print the first field of the file (part-00000)\n",
    "\n",
    "```awk -F \",\" '{ print $1 }' retail_db/orders/part-00000```\n",
    "\n",
    "* To print  (space) as a delimiter in place of ,(comma)\n",
    "\n",
    "```awk -F \",\" '{ print $1 \" \" $2 }' retail_db/orders/part-00000 |head```\n",
    "\n",
    "* To print all the records(everything) in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```awk -F \",\" '{ print $0 }' retail_db/orders/part-00000 |head```\n",
    "\n",
