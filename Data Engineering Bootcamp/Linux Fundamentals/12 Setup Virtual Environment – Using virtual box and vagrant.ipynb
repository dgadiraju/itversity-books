    "### We will be talking about virtualization from the personal usage perspective\n",
    "In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualization is very very important. Understanding virtual machine’s and creating virtual machines quickly to explore technologies is key to learn any technology faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different tools for creating virtual machines\n",
    "To create virtual machines we should have one of the following software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualization tools(PC):\n",
    "* VMWare Workstation (Windows)\n",
    "* VMWare Fusion (Mac)\n",
    "* VirtualBox (open source)\n",
    "* KVM (Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will be using VirtualBox.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up virtual box\n",
    "* To download the VirtualBox application, Go to **https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads**\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like this\n",
    "* From the list, you can select windows hosts. Then it will download.\n",
    "* Once the download is completed, go to the location where you have saved the file and double-click on it. A welcome window will open. Hit next and accept the conditions. Click next to install the VirtualBox in your computer.\n",
    "* Next window will ask you to install the VirtualBox. Go ahead and hit Install\n",
    "* VirtualBox will be installed in your computer. This process will take a few minutes.\n",
    "* Once the installation is completed hit Finish and open the VirtualBox in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a virtual host and installing the operating system\n",
    "* Now if you want to create a virtual machine using VirtualBox you have to have operating system image.\n",
    "* Before downloading the OS you can create a virtual host.\n",
    "* Open VirtualBox and Click on New and choose the operating system you want to install. Here we are using centos7 of Linux type with Red Hat (64-bit) version.\n",
    "* Now, select the amount of memory(RAM) in megabytes. Here we have given 2GB of memory.\n",
    "* Create a virtual hard drive. Here we given 8GB of storage.\n",
    "* Then, click on continue and continue and create. Now, it has created a Virtual Machine.\n",
    "* Now, you can download the centos7 image and install the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features such as cloning, firewalls etc\n",
    "When you **clone** a drive, you make an exact copy of the virtual machine that can be used on either the same host or moved to another **VirtualBox** host. The process of **cloning** and moving a virtual machine is now easy in VirtualBox. In fact, there are no more commands for **cloning**, as the process is built into the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automating creation of multiple VMs using tools like vagrant\n",
    "* To use vagrant you need to have VirtualBox or KVM or any virtualization software.\n",
    "* Go to **vagrantup.com**\n",
    "* Download vagrant and install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use below commands to set up Vagrant"
