    "Let us go through the rationale behind NoSQL Databases. As part of the evolution of Databases, one of the key milestones is RDBMS. They are extensively used for applications where transactions are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "But over a period of time, we have other types of systems where transactions are not that important – eg: recommendation engine, endorsements, messengers etc. For these type of applications using RDBMS is counterproductive. NoSQL provide us alternative databases which are not only cheaper but also scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Use Cases***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see some use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Facebook Messenger\n",
    "* Majority of LinkedIn Website components such as job recommendations, endorsements etc.\n",
    "* Streaming Executive Dashboards which are time series in nature.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us go through some of the popular NoSQL databases available for us. Even though concepts are same, syntax and semantics are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "* HBase – comes as part of Hadoop eco system with most of the distributions such as Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR etc.\n",
    "* Cassandra – the most popular NoSQL database which can work with Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark etc.\n",
    "* MongoDB – simple, easy to use NoSQL database with rich querying capabilities and works seamlessly with Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark etc.\n",
    "* DynamoDB – popular NoSQL database with in amazon eco system\n",
    "* MapR DB – MapR version of HBase.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Job Roles***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see the job roles who use NoSQL Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Engineers – NoSQL is a popular choice in building streaming pipelines.\n",
    "* Application Developers – Building applications with minimum transaction features.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let us see the typical learning process for exploring NoSQL Databases.\n",

    "### NoSQL Concepts/Features\n",
    "All NoSQL databases comes with these capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key and Value – each row will have a key and value. Value typically contain attributes and respective values. It is very close to XML or JSON.\n",
    "* Indexed – Data will be typically sorted and indexed based on row key.\n",
    "* Partitioned – Data will be partitioned by row key column. It also known as sharded/sharding.\n",
    "* Replication – There will be multiple copies of data\n",
    "* Commit log – For restore and recovery of the data\n",
    "* CAP algorithm – Consistency, Accessibility and Partition Tolerance\n",
    "* Minor and major compaction – periodic merging of files with in each partition so that we will not end up having too many small files\n",
    "* Tombstones – soft delete of data\n",
    "* Vacuum Cleaning – hard delete of data\n",
    "* Consistency Level – Commit point. As we have multiple copies of data consistency level determines whether data is considered to be committed when one copy is updated or all the copies are updated. It is determined depending up on the criticality of data and desired performance for the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<q>*While indexing and partitioning serves the purpose of scalability in terms of performance, replication serves the purpose of reliability of database. Even though we do not cover these terms extensively, it is good to understand all these terms in detail.*</q>\n",

    "* There are 2 types of schemas in HBase – Thick Schema and Thin Schema\n",
    "* In RDBMS typically we will have Normalized Data Model where the relationships are established and enforced. In NoSQL, * we typically do not enforce relationships at the database layer and schemas need not be normalized.\n",
