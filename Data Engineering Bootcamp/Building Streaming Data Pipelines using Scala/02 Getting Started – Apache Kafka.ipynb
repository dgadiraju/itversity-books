    "**Topic:** A topic represent group of files and directories. When we create topic, it will create directories with topic name and partition index. These directories have bunch of files which will actually store the messages that are being produced.\n",

    "**Publisher or Producer:** Publishers or producers are processes that publish data (push messages) to the log file associated with Kafka topic.\n",

    "***Replication Factor:*** Each partition can be cloned into multiple copies using replication factor. It will facilitate fault tolerance. With replication factor of n on m node cluster (where n <= m), cluster can survive the failure of n-1 nodes at any point in time.\n",

    "* Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name, and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group.\n",
    "* This process of maintaining membership in the group is handled by Kafka dynamically. If new instances join the group they will take over some partitions from other members of the group; if an instance dies, its partitions will be distributed to the remaining instances.\n",
    "* To consume data in parallel from topic which is partitioned, we need to have separate consumer for each partition. At any given point in time more than one consumer cannot consume data from same partition.\n",

    "Now let us recap how messages are produced to topic and consumed from topic. Also we will look into the details about format related to Message batch and Message. Message is also synonymous to Record.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Producer produces messages to Kafka topic in batches for performance reasons.\n",
    "* All the messages are appended to the log files associated with partitions.\n",
    "* We can have key for each message (using APIs). Keys are used in partitioning the data as well as log compaction if the logs have to be replayed.\n",
    "* Partitions are allocated to the message either in round robin fashion (when there is no key) or based on hash mod value on key.\n",
    "* Consumer periodically poll into Kafka topic partition using offset and read messages continuously from the topic.\n",
    "* As messages are produced in batches, there will be some information for each batch as well as some information for each message with in batch written to log file (along with actual messages)\n",
    "* Advantages of batching\n",
    "    * As part of producing messages we can send larger TCP packets leveraging network bandwidth. It is always better in performance compared to sending individual messages and waiting for acknowledgements.\n",
    "    * Compression rates will be much higher with larger batch of messages than individual messages.\n",
    "* When batching is used producer will take care of grouping messages for each partition and append to the log file associated with the partition by talking to the leader of respective partitions.\n",
    "* Even while consuming data it is not advisable to consume individual messages and commit offset for each message. Performance will be poor.\n",
    "* As we typically consume multiple messages in each iteration, our consumers should have necessary logic to deal with errors in such a way that same data is not duplicated in the target system.\n",
